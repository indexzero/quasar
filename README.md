### Requirements
   Depends on the SilverlightToolkit and is currently using the December 2008 drop.

### Quality Bands
   Currently all controls in Quasar are in the pre-Alpha stages of development. I have tried to outline all of the limitations in "Limitations below."

   1. pre-Alpha: There are no unit tests, sample usage in Quasar.Samples, or other documentation.
   2. Alpha: There is sample usage in Quasar.Samples and limited documentation 
   3. Beta: There are unit tests, sample usage in Quasar.Samples, and limited documentation
   4. Released: Ready for prime time.

### Dependencies  
   1. Built against Silverlight 2 RTM
   2. Silverlight Toolkit, December 2008

### Limitations
   1. AttachedDragDropBehavior
	* EventHandlers cannot be set in ControlTemplates
	* EventHandlers must be public methods on whatever class they are declared
   2. AttachedEventHandlerManager
	* EventHandlers cannot be set in ControlTemplates
	* EventHandlers must be public methods on whatever class they are declared
   3. ImageListView
        * The ImageListViewItem does not utilize any sort of bounding (i.e. ViewBox), so there may be possible clipping in some Stretch usage scenarios. 
   4. LightBox
        * Currently has no "Adorner" like layer built into it, so to get the faded background effect, you must have it stretch to the entire area.
